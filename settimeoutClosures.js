//created a func with 1000 milli sec=>i sec timer
function x() {
  var i = 1;
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000);
}

x();

//it pritns value of i after one sec.
//IF WE GIVE  3000 milli secs, it prints after 3secs

function x() {
  var i = 1;
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000);
  console.log("namaste js");
}

x();

//the above code will first prints 'namaste js' then after 1 sec  and print i
// How and y it is printing like this means bcoz, this function   passed to settimeout forms a closure , it remembers a reference to I and forms a closure.
// Wherever this fucn goes , it  takes the ref of I along with it.
// Settimeout will takes this callback func and stores it in some place. And attach a timer to it.
// And js will proceeds with next lines.
// Once the timer expires (1000 ms completed) then it takes the func and runs  by putting it in callstack.
// So js doesnâ€™t wait any time .

// Situation :
// Suppose printing 1,2,3,4,5 after each and every sec.
// Most developers do it using for loop as below.
