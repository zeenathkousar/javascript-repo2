// First class functions:
// What are pure functions?
// https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pure-functions-in-javascript/
// A Pure Function is a function (a block of code) that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed. It does not depend on any state or data change during a programâ€™s execution. Rather, it only depends on its input arguments.

//  If output is not depended on some outer variable, then the output will be fixed for fixed argument.
// For eg- u can refer above geeksforgeeks link.
// What is an anonymous function?
// A function without a name is known as anonymous functions.
// What are first class functions?
// Function stmt vs function expression vs function declaration?

//function statment
// function a() {
//   console.log("a called");
// }

//this way of creating a function is known as function stmt.
//The function statement declares a function. A declared function is "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when it is invoked (called).

//function expression
//in js, we have a feature to assign a function to a variable also- it is kwnon as function expression
//here function acts as a value to that variable. we are initializing b with some value.
// var b = function () {
//   console.log("b called");
// };

//these above 2 are the 2 ways to create a function.

//difference between the above 2- function stmt vs function expression is-

//major difference is hoisting -
// to call first function - u call  by using a(); and to call 2nd , u call by using b();
//how hoisting come into picture means
//lets take first type and call the function even before creating it.- similarly do for function expression and check.
a();
b();
function a() {
  console.log("a called");
}

var b = function () {
  console.log("b called");
};

//so from above ccode, we can observe that - function a  that is function stmt is supporting hoisting, worked same.
//  but  for b - got err - as b is not a function . so this function expression is not getting hoisted.

//so this is the difference between function stmt and function expression.
// so during hoisting phase or during memory creation phase., a is created a memory and this func is assigned to a.
// but during func expression , this b is treated as any other variable and it is  assigned undefined until it reaches  this assignmennt function exp line.
// until that definition line, it will be undefined.
//so here as b value is undefined , u cannot call b.

//function declaration:

//function stmt is also known as function declaration.

//anonymous functions:.
// a function without  name is knwon as anonymous function.

// function (){
//     //but this will give a syntax err -
// }

// above  func looks like a function stmt, but has no name,
// but according to ecmascript, function stmt should always have  a name,
//so above is invalid syntax
//run - syntax err- function stmts require  a function name

//so anonymous functions are used in a place where functions are used as values.

// so anonymous functions are used when funcs are used as values.
//u can use it to assign to some variables.

//so see the eg of function expression, there the value of b is a anonymous function used as a value to b.

// named function expression.:
// named  function expression is exactly same as function expression, but instead of anonymous func assigned to b there no, there we assign a named function,
var b = function xyz() {
  //now this becomes a named func expression
  console.log("b called");
};

//b() - we can call it as b(),
//xyz() - but if i do like this, then we get err -  reference err- xyz is not defined
// here  b will be created but xyz will not be created.

//difference  between parameters and arguments.

var b = function (param1, param2) {
  //here param1 and param2 are known as parameters , as they present in function def.
  //here param1 and param2 are local variables to this func , we cant access outside.
  console.log("b called");
};

// the arguments which we give to a function while calling it . they are known as arguments.
// b(arg1,arg2) ; here arg1 and arg2 are known as Parameters.

//first class functions:
// while calling a function, instead of values 1,2 like that we can pass a whole function as a argument., we can pass anonymou funtion and we can  receive a func as argumernt.it is perfect js .

// var c = function (param1) {
//   console.log(param1); //we get func def as output
// };

// c(function () {});

//there is one more way to pass this function inside the function  like a named function as below.
// var c = function (param1) {
//   console.log(param1); //we get func def as output
// };
// function xyz() {}
// c(xyz); //same as above way

//we can even return a anonymous function from a function

// var c = function (param1) {
//   // console.log(param1);
//   return function () {};
// };
// console.log(c()); //same as above way

// similarly we can return named function

var c = function (param1) {
  // console.log(param1);
  return function xyz() {};
};
console.log(c()); //same as above way

//so this is nothing but first class fucntions
//the ability to use functions as values is known as first class functions. and  can be passed as an arg to another funtionand can be returned  from a fucntion. this ability is known as first class fucntions.

//first class functions and first class citizens are same.

// es6 introduced arrow functions in 2015
//this function stmt, expression  all can be created using arrow functions also
